Hide the “add to cart” button for products imported from ALiexpress and which have no shipping methods for the customer's delivery address.

== Description ==

Products imported from Aliexpress each have a shipping method list corresponding to the country of delivery.

This plugin allows you to display a personalized message instead of the “add to cart” when the current product does not have shipping methods.
